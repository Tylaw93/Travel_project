Overall this was a great experience, working with someone else for the first time on a collaborative sense. Communicating so that we are on the same page as the project progresses and evaluating our scope as the deadline gets closer. Looking forward to the next project.
I was able to get more practice with APIs on the weather portion and got deep into the Tailwind documentation more than once.
Tips and tricks for this type of project? Read the documentation, console.log is your friend, commit early and often.

I did a bit of Googling during this project, mainly for things that I got 90% of the way there and needed a little hint at the end Tailwind documentation was a big help. I did watch a Tailwind intro from TraversyMedia on YouTube which was great in helping me decide to move on when Bulma was causing a headache.
