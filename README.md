Though a bit hard to manage my time this project was a huge success in terms of communication and cooperation. I was very fortunate to have a level headed partner who was willing to look over code with me, as well as give me succinct notes to traverse the DOM. I look forward to working with Mike and my other classmates in the future.
The main thing I learned during this project was to take your time and commit often, one misplaced ) or } can make a world of difference in the execution of your code and may not return an error.

Overall this was a great experience, working with someone else for the first time on a collaborative sense. Communicating so that we are on the same page as the project progresses and evaluating our scope as the deadline gets closer. Looking forward to the next project.
I was able to get more practice with APIs on the weather portion and got deep into the Tailwind documentation more than once.
Tips and tricks for this type of project? Read the documentation, console.log is your friend, commit early and often.

I spent most of my time digging through the various Apis we used in order to find the relevant  data. After that some of the local storage gave me issues due to needing to deal with nested arrays but in the end I pulled it together. The main two Apis had great documentation so I had plenty of reference material.

I did a bit of Googling during this project, mainly for things that I got 90% of the way there and needed a little hint at the end Tailwind documentation was a big help. I did watch a Tailwind intro from TraversyMedia on YouTube which was great in helping me decide to move on when Bulma was causing a headache.
