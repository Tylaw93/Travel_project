const form = document.getElementById("searchForm");

/* Tyler, #searchForm is added to index.html, and linked to an eventListener that uses the 'search' function below, where you'll work your magic
		the section holding the form is #searchContainer
		the form itself is #searchForm
		the checkboxes are #museum, #park, #venue
		the button is #searchFormBtn

		the section for your output is #listContainer, there is nothing in there, I figured the list would be generated by the js and appended
